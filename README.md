<h1>Pet Project of website of University</h1>
<h4>This is a website for a university that I developed as a pet project using Java and various technologies including Spring MVC, Spring JDBC, Spring Core, SLF4J, Lombok, Apache Tomcat. JUnit and Mockito.</h4>
<h4>The project utilizes PostgreSQL as its database management system and Tomcat as its servlet container. To ensure testing of every part of the system, I utilize JUnit and Mockito. Additionally, I created a UML diagram to aid in the development of the project.</h4>
